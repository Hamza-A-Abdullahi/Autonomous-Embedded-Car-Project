# Autonomous-Embedded-Car-Project

This project was for the creation of an autonomous embedded car that would initially follow a black line on the flow and would independently correct itself if the course altered.

The car would also use ultrasound and infrared sensors to avoid obstables on the track.

Usage of:
Motor Actuators
Pulse Wave Modulation
Infrared Sensors
Ultrasound Sensors
